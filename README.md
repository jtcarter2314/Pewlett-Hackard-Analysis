# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Using knowledge of tabular data and Data Analysis, the use of ERDs (entity relationship diagrams), import the data into a database, and create queries to use the data to answer questions within a SQL method.

## Results

This diagram helps establish logical, physical and conceptual layout to help give more exposure to the data.

Lastly, we were instructed to create a Mentorship Eligibility table that holds the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Summary

In this module, we used all skills we developed to help give a layout of the data to help picture our objective,then when that is accomplished used all the SQL statements and importing data to tables to get the answers for what the module is asking for.
